# Austin-Animal-Outcomes
This project explores adoption outcomes at the Austin Animal Center using a dataset of over 150,000 records from 2013 to 2023. Working as a team, we cleaned and analyzed data on animal types, breeds, and adoption timing to identify patterns linked to successful adoptions. We then built predictive models to help shelters better understand which animals are less likely to be adopted, enabling more targeted outreach and support. The goal was to combine data analysis with social impact by providing insights that could improve animal welfare and adoption strategies.
